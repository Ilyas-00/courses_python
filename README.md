# NumPy Course Notes

These are my personal notes from a NumPy course. The notes are divided into two parts: Part 2/3 and Part 3/3.

## Part 2/3

### Basic NumPy Operations


In this part, we covered the basics of working with NumPy arrays.

#### Array Creation

- Importing NumPy and setting up Google Drive integration.
- Creating a NumPy array using `np.arange`.
- Slicing and indexing arrays.
- Modifying array elements and making copies.

#### 2D Arrays

- Creating and manipulating 2D arrays.
- Accessing elements and slices in 2D arrays.
- Applying boolean indexing to filter array elements.

## Part 3/3

### NumPy Operations and Functions

In this part, we explored various NumPy operations and functions.

#### Array Arithmetic

- Basic arithmetic operations on arrays.
- Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Mathematical functions like square root, logarithm, and sine.

#### Array Statistics

- Calculating statistics like sum, mean, max, variance, and standard deviation on arrays.
- Working with 2D arrays and performing similar calculations.
- Using `axis` parameter to specify row or column-wise calculations.

## Conclusion

These notes serve as a reference for working with NumPy, from basic array creation and manipulation to more advanced arithmetic and statistical operations. You can refer to these notes whenever you need to refresh your knowledge on NumPy concepts.

Feel free to use and share these notes, and check out the code and examples in the respective course sections.

Happy coding!
